II. Answer the following question. What does this do?   

1. ls [A-Z]*  (lists the files of the directory A-Z) 
#List all files whit uppercase

2. cp *.sh /tmp  (Copy a temporary file with zero or more characters, except a leading dot (hidden file))
# Incorrect! `*` is a wildcard to copy all .sh files to the tmp direcotory  

3. man pwd     (Show the help page of the current directory)

# Correct! But it wil print on a less format

these specific directories or files and send located ones as input to xargs mv /tmp command which adds the files output by grep to the
tmp folder.
